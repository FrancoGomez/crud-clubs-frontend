# Crud clubs frontend

This proyect was made as an extra homework for class 17 of [r/Argentina Programa](https://argentinaprograma.com/).

The idea behind it was to make a full web app, with a frontend that just uses request to interact with the [backend](https://github.com/FrancoGomez/crud-clubs-backend) (which holds all the info, because there is no database yet). This proyect allows you to:

    C - Create
    R - Retrive
    U - Update
    D - Delete

With every football club avaible, using the [Football Data](https://www.football-data.org/) format in the database.

Test the [deployed version](https://crud-clubs-frontend.vercel.app)

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/FrancoGomez/crud-clubs-frontend.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd crud-clubs-frontend
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Fill the env.js file with your own information, which must be at root level

```bash
  const BACKEND_PORT =

  const BACKEND_URL =

  const GOOGLE_KEY =
```

**Optional** Fill the env-test.js file with your own information, which must be at root level too. This one is for cypress testing.

```bash
  const FRONT_PORT =

  const FRONTEND_URL =
```

And start a server, for which I was using a VSCode extension called Live Server.
